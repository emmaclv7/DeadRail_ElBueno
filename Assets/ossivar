<h3>Backstory</h3>
<p>Ossivar&#39;s existence is known only to the dust and shadows of a forgotten world. No one knows when he first appeared or who crafted him from the myriad of bones strewn across a desolate expanse. Over epochs, he became a collection of forgotten memories—fragments of fallen warriors and artisans echoing their last dreams within him. </p>
<p>As he crafted with the bones of the dead, Ossivar’s only company is the cacophony of whispers from his foundational shards. Each piece in him is a tale waiting to be told. He strives to create Arcis Ossium, a fortress embodying harmony in death and peace in sacrifice.</p>
<p>Ossivar seeks not vengeance or hatred but an understanding of existence. While he knows the concepts of love and grief, he cannot understand them fully. He finds that craftsmanship is a means to connect with the lost, and so he carves in silence under the stars, driven by a longing to learn more about his own identity and destiny.</p>
